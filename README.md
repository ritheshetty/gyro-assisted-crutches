# smart-assistive-crutches
IoT-based "smart crutches" that help a patient learn how to hold crutches in the optimal manner to avoid injury to the axillary nerve and minimize weight on the injured foot.

Abstract from a national-level competition where the project won "Best Idea" to help better understand the project:

"I'll walk on my hands before I use crutches", is the general consensus among people when it comes to these
mobility aids, and for good reason...they're cumbersome and starting off with them after an injury/surgery can
be quite a task, as they require practice. Quite a few people cause themselves additional harm by incorrect positioning
of the crutches during this practice phase, leading to loss of balance. Therefore, we think it prudent to augment the 
capabilities of this vital medical apparatus. 
We plan on designing a "Smart Crutch", whose primary function is to inform the user of the right angles 
to plant the crutch, to prevent detrimental falls and also for effective load distribution so as to minimize 
pressure on the injured limb. This would make the initial learning curve less steep, avert further harm and 
improve the afflicted person's experience with crutches. As a secondary feature, we also propose to store and 
harvest the pressure energy generated at the bottom of the crutch via piezoelectric sensors, to power small devices 
such as smart watches.  
The implementation of the idea will be through an Arduino setup connected to two sensors, an accelerometer
and a gyroscope, which will be coded to calculate the required angles. If the crutches are planted at an unsuited 
inclination, then the user is warned via LEDs and he/she can correct the angle. We also plan on creating a mobile application
to send an SOS to select contacts in the unfortunate event of a fall. We will demonstrate how the piezoelectric material
would produce the electrical energy as well.
